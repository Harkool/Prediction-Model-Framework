## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Prepare Data**  
   Ensure the following files are in the same directory:
   - `traindata.CSV` : Training dataset
   - `testdata.CSV`  : Testing dataset  
   (Ensure column names match the feature definitions in the scripts)

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn xgboost catboost matplotlib shap
   ```

3. **Run the Pipeline**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Select Feature Set**
   In `main.py`, choose between:
   ```python
   feature_set = pre_features    # Preoperative model
   # feature_set = full_features # Preoperative + Intraoperative model
   ```
